In order for the LMCracker.java service to work, the following conditions must
be true.

1. This directory exists
2. This directory has child directories:
	- ophcrack-3.7.0-bin
	- tables_xp_free_fast
	- tempFiles
3. ophcrack-3.7.0-bin contains all the files provided in the .zip file 
	downloaded from : http://ophcrack.sourceforge.net/download.php?type=ophcrack
4. tables_xp_free_fast contains all the files provided in the .zip file 
	downloaded from : http://ophcrack.sourceforge.net/tables.php
	
See "example.png" for an example of the correct directory structure. 
Note that in the screenshot the files "log.txt", "in.txt", and "out.txt" are not
required; they were created by the program itself.
